# Enable Wifi:
sudo iwlist wlan0 scan | more       # scans for interfaces. Confirm that the network you want is there and what it's name is.
sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf        # edit wpa_supplicant for wifi connection
# for example, you might add:
#   network={
#      ssid="The_ESSID_for your network"
#      psk="Your_wifi_password"
#   }

# reboot the pi.
