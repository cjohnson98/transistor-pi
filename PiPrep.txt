# These commands set up the pi for transistor-pi on a Raspian OS image. 
# Do these things after writing the OS image to the pi SD card.

# basic configuration: Note: most of this is easiest to handle through the Raspian GUI now.
sudo raspi-config
# opens the raspberry pi configuration tool. Within the tool:
# 1. Expand filesystem
# 2. Change the user password
# 3. Internationalization options:
#    set locale
#    select keyboard
#    Set time zone
# 4. Advanced options:
#    Set hostname
#    Enable SSH
#    Enable SPI

# Enable Wifi:
sudo iwlist wlan0 scan | more       # scans for interfaces. Confirm that the network you want is there and what it's name is.
sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf        # edit wpa_supplicant for wifi connection
# for example, you might add:
#   network={
#      ssid="The_ESSID_for your network"
#      psk="Your_wifi_password"
#   }

# reboot the pi.

# confirm wifi connection and get ip address:
ifconfig wlan0
# will return connection information. Note the ip address.

# return to the pi configuration tool.
sudo raspi-config
# under Advanced options, select Update to update the configuration tool.

# install mc:
sudo apt-get install mc

# update everything:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo rpi-update        # updates firmware. Note: may need to revert to earlier firmware if spi not working.

# install mpc:
sudo apt-get install mpc mpd

# install samba:
sudo apt-get install samba samba-common-bin

# add samba user:
sudo smbpasswd -a pi
# enter password at prompt

# backup /etc/samba/smb.conf

# edit smb.conf:
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
# Change workgroup to suit network (or leave workgroup as WORKGROUP)
# uncomment WINS support line and change line to read WINS support = yes
# go to bottom of file and add share:
#   [USBSTICK]    (or name share as desired)
#   comment = Album files
#   path = /media/pi/USBSTICK
#   create mask = 0775
#   directory mask = 0775
#   read only = no
#   browseable = yes
#   public = yes
#   force user = pi
#   only guest = no

# test samba configuration:
testparm

# restart samba (or reboot pi):
sudo service smbd restart
sudo service nmbd restart

# Test. Share should be accessible from Windows now.

# format usb memory stick and copy music to it
