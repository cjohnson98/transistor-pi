# transistor-pi

Raspberry Pi guts for a transistor radio chassis.

Uses a Raspberry Pi to play audio two ways:

1. Access audio files stored on a USB drive, similar to how a cheap MP3 player works.
2. Access Internet radio streams.

Uses potentiometers feeding A to D converters to provide input to the Pi for stream/file selection and volume control, allowing the use of the volume and tuning knobs on the original radio chassis.
